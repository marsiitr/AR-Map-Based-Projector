## ABSTRACT:

AR Based Map Projector is hands-on sandbox combined with 3 D visualisation applications where sand is augmented in real-time with an elevation color map.Simply mold the sand by hand and the landscape comes to life! The AR Sandbox uses a 3D camera such as the Microsoft Kinect to scan the 3D shape of the sand surface in real time.A computer collects data from the camera, and creates a real-time dynamic topography map using the Processing software program. A projector, also mounted above the sandbox, projects that topography map back onto the real sand, calibrated such that real and virtual features line up exactly.

## Motivation
Aerial Mapping and surveying.

## Mechanical Aspect of the Design:
1. Sandbox of dimensions(75*60cm)
2. Stand for kinect (mount on the plywood base of sandbox ,height 80-100cm,30cm long card board with a slot to mount kinect)
3. Stand for projector opposite to kinect stand(height= 170cm)
4. Table for laptop
5. White sand

## Electronics Aspect of the Design:
1. Extension board 
2. Microsoft kinect v2
3. Benq projector
4. Hdmi cable

## Softwares used
1. Kinect SDK
2. KinectConfigurationVerifier
3. Processing-3.5.3
4. Kinect Pv2 library


## Cost Structure:

|S.No|Components  |    Cost (INR)      |
|-------|------------|-------------| 
|1| Kinect           |5000   | 
|2| Projector           |22000 | 
|3| White sand           |500 |
|4|Nut,Bolt,Aluminium Rod,L Joints|300 |




## Applications:

- Dynamic projection
- Projection on uneven surface
- Projection on building
- Military application
- In oil industries
- To determine water flow pattern in valleys(dam construction)

## Limitations:

Range of depth sensor is accurate in range of 50cm-4.5m

## Future Improvements:

1. Perspective transformation to make depth mapping more accurate.
2. Add water flow animation to study water flow in valleys
