# AR-Map-Based-Projector
Srishti 2019


## ABSTRACT:

A R Based Map Projector A R Sandbox is hands-on sandbox combined with 3 D visualisation applications where sand is augmented in real-time with an elevation color map, topographic contour lines, and simulated water.Simply mold the sand by hand and the landscape comes to life! The AR Sandbox uses a 3D camera such as the Microsoft Kinect to scan the 3D shape of the sand surface in real time.A computer collects data from the camera, and creates a real-time dynamic topography map using the Processing software program. A projector, also mounted above the sandbox, projects that topography map back onto the real sand, calibrated such that real and virtual features line up exactly.

## Motivation
Aerial Mapping and surveying.

## Mechanical Aspect of the Design:
1. Sandbox of dimensions(75*60cm)
2. stand for kinect (mount on the plywood base of sandbox ,height 80-100cm,30cm long card board with a slot to mount kinect)
3. stand for projector opposite to kinect stand(height= 170cm)
4. table for laptop
5. white sand

## Electronics Aspect of the Design:
1. entension board 
2. microsoft kinect
3. benq projector
4. hdmi cable

## Cost Structure:
- Kinect:Rs 5000
- Projector:Rs 22000
- white sand: (10 kg) Rs 100
- (nut,bolt,aluminium rod,L joints): Rs 300


## Applications:

- dynamic projection
- projection on uneven surface
- projetion on building
- military application
- oil industries
- To determine water flow pattern in valleys(dam construction)

## Limitations:

Range of depth sensor is accurate in range of 50cm-4.5m

## Future Improvements:

1. Perspective transformation to make depth mapping more accurate.
2. add water flow animation to study water flow in valleys
